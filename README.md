Story Generation Stuff

Main notebook is notebooks/T5_HF_orig.ipynb. You can run that cell-by-cell for the most part -- make sure you install the correct versions of `transformers` and `datasets` in the first cell.  
You will also need to download the datasets here: [test](https://drive.google.com/file/d/134C7w3fNvzsUbLvjnhdatYraTwcfeqDw/view?usp=sharing) and [train](https://drive.google.com/file/d/119C50en6LvOBjhyFMBdEX2QRcbKbwiQg/view?usp=sharing).
Unzip these to `glucose/data_final`.

TODO: reorganize the directories -- probably move the notebooks to glucose/notebooks
