# Careful with Context

This repository contains the code used to run the experiments for the paper ``Careful with Context: A Critique of Commonsense Inference Methods.''

You will need to download the datasets here: [test](https://drive.google.com/file/d/134C7w3fNvzsUbLvjnhdatYraTwcfeqDw/view?usp=sharing) and [train](https://drive.google.com/file/d/119C50en6LvOBjhyFMBdEX2QRcbKbwiQg/view?usp=sharing).
Unzip these to `glucose/data_final`.

The main run script is `glucose/scripts/run_pipeline.sh`. Refer to that for more instructions on running our experiments.

TODO: reorganize the directories -- probably move the notebooks to glucose/notebooks
TODO: rewrite the README to make sure others can run it
